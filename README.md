Wordpress Server Check
=============

This script is at a very early stage. It can be used to do a quick assessment of a webserver to determine if the server is ready for a Wordpress installation.
You need to fill in you mySQL data in the script to ensure proper function.

Usage:

- Upload the script to your directory of choice on the webserver
- Change the host, username and password for the SQL check on line 33,34 and 35.
- Open the php file in your webbrowser and see if the server is ready for Wordpress.
